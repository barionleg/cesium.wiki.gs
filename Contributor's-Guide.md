## Setting up Eclipse

Although we encourage contributors to use their IDE of choice, many of us use Eclipse.  Here is how we set it up:

* Install [http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp](Java) if it isn't already.
* Download [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/](Eclipse IDE) for JavaScript Web Developers.  Extract to a directory of your choice.
