This is a collection of books, tutorials, blogs, and other resources to bring folks up to speed on the technology used by Cesium, not Cesium itself.

## Foundational Knowledge

These resources present topics broadly useful to Cesium development.  We think all contributors should read them.

### JavaScript

* [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do) - concise, practical introduction to modern JavaScript for developers familiar with another language.  Also see a related [YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQVTIJBZook).

* [Real-Time Rendering](http://www.realtimerendering.com/) - a broad survey of real-time rendering.  If you own only one graphics book, this should be it.  The authors also maintain a list of practically all [graphics books](http://www.realtimerendering.com/books.html).

### Open Source

* [Producing Open Source Software](http://producingoss.com/) - influenced the Cesium development culture more so than any other book.  Now a bit dated (pre-GitHub), but a new edition is in the works.
