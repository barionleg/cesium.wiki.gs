Ideas for improving the main Cesium website, [cesium.agi.com](http://cesium.agi.com/).

* General style and design improvements, e.g., using the Cesium colors as @kristiancalhoun did in his hackathon app.
* Show; don't tell.  Let's have a small Cesium demo embedded in the main page.
* Our github wiki has great content and is easy to edit, but it doesn't have the visibility, look, and feel that it should.  Let's sync our github wiki with the website, e.g., every time we update the wiki, a script updates the Cesium website.  Actually, we could do this with any repo, and change the github wiki to just link to the website so we don't have the same pages in two different spots.  We'll have to change some deep links elsewhere, but there aren't too many.
   * In general, our the website should be easy to deploy to.  Right now only a few of us know how to do it.  Why can't the whole thing (minus custom servers) be one repo?
   * Many screenshots need improvements, for example, some images on the [features](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/wiki/Features) page are too dark.
   * Issue [#201](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/201) - add Sandcastle links to the features page.
* Add a blog as [discussed](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cesium-dev/tKul8BPg_DU) on the mailing list.
   * It would be awesome if there are solid tools to integrate the writing process with github, but I'd be OK with WordPress, which is very well established.
* Polish demos (really a separate, orthogonal effort).  Details TBA.  Ideas welcome.
