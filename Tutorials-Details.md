The [architecture overview](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/wiki/Architecture) and [reference documentation](http://cesium.agi.com/Cesium/Build/Documentation/) should link to the tutorials.

## Writing Tips

* Be _representative_, not _exhaustive_.  Give readers specific examples, guiding principles, and a sense of what is possible.  Don't feel the need to mention every function and property; that's what the [reference documentation](http://cesium.agi.com/Cesium/Build/Documentation/) is for.
* Be concise, direct, and friendly.
* General Outline
   * Brief introduction
   * Short code walkthrough with screenshots that builds on the [Cesium Viewer Widget](http://cesium.agi.com/Cesium/Apps/Sandcastle/index.html?src=Cesium%20Viewer%20Widget.html) Sandcastle example.
   * Selected details
   * Resources - related [Sandcastle examples](http://cesium.agi.com/Cesium/Apps/Sandcastle/), [reference documentation](http://cesium.agi.com/Cesium/Build/Documentation/), the [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cesium-dev), etc.
* Tutorials are more informal and less comprehensive than [in-depth guides](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/wiki/In-Depth-Guides).
