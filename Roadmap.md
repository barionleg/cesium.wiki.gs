# Roadmap

We're always looking to:
* Write demos that showcase Cesium, especially demos that combine Cesium with other web APIs
* Support more content by writing converters from other formats (GML, [GeoJSON](http://www.geojson.org/), [TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson), [gpx](http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp) ...) to CZML using our [czml-writer](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/czml-writer) library
* Write [tutorials](Tutorials-Details) and improve reference documentation and examples
* Improve visual quality and performance - [details](Visual-Quality-and-Performance-Details)
* Improve platform support by fixing issues on various browsers, devices, or video cards
* Improve tests and test coverage; however, we don't blindly chase coverage statistics

## In progress
* Tutorials - [details](Tutorials-Details)
* Streaming terrain - [details](Streaming-Terrain-Details)
* Ocean improvements - [details](Ocean-Details)
* COLLADA models - [details](Models-Details)
* Widget improvements - [details](Widget-Details)
* Playback widget - [details](Playback-Details)
* Space features - [details](Space-features)

## To come

If you are interested in implementing any of these features, start a discussion on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/cesium-dev).

* Mobile improvements - [details](Mobile-Details)
