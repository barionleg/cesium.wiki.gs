# Roadmap

## Always

We're always looking to:
* Write demos that showcase Cesium, especially demos that combine Cesium with other web APIs.
* Support more content by writing converters from other formats to CZML using our [czml-writer](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/czml-writer) library.
* Write tutorials and improve reference documentation and examples.
* Improve visual quality and performance.
* Improve platform support by fixing issues on various browsers, devices, or video cards.
* Improve tests and test coverage; however, we don't blindly chase coverage statistics.

## Near term

* Flesh out material system
* Stars
* Data-driven renderer
