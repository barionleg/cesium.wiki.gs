These are the social norms when working in the main repo.

* Make changes on a separate branch, and open a pull request to merge into master.
* Review any pull request that interests you.  Merge pull requests that you and other reviewers are confident in.  See the [Code Review Tips](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/wiki/Code-Review-Tips).
* Before merging a pull request, check [CONTRIBUTORS.md](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md) to verify that the contributor has a CLA.  If they do not have a CLA, email cesium-committers@googlegroups.com and we'll ask for one.
* We release monthly and encourage everyone to volunteer once in awhile.  See the [Release Guide](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/wiki/Release-Guide).
* If a contributor has significant and sustained contributions and should have commit access, propose it on cesium-committers@googlegroups.com.  Following the [Apache Way](http://community.apache.org/newcommitter.html), they will be given commit access with three yes votes and no no's over a week.  To keep with the community spirit of the project, this is independent of affiliation; no one is entitled to commit access solely based on their affiliation.  See Producing Open Source Software: [Money Can't Buy You Love](http://producingoss.com/en/money-vs-love.html) and [Committers](http://producingoss.com/en/committers.html). Anyone granted commit access to Cesium will be required to also enable [two-factor authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication) on their GitHub account.
