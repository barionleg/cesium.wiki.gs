These are the social norms when working in the main repo.

* Make changes on a separate branch, and open a pull request to merge into master.
* Review any pull request that interests you.  Merge pull requests that you and other reviewers are confident in.  See our [code review tips](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/wiki/Code-Review-Tips).
* Before merging a pull request, check [CONTRIBUTORS.md](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md) to verify that the contributor has a CLA.  If they do not have a CLA, email cesium-committers@googlegroups.com and we'll ask for one.
* We release monthly and encourage everyone to volunteer once in awhile.  See the [Release Guide](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/wiki/Release-Guide).
