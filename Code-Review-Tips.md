All of our code is peer reviewed before merging a pull request into master.  We review code to share knowledge; foster shared ownership; and improve code quality and consistency.

Tips
* GitHub's [code review tools](https://github.com/features/projects/codereview) are awesome.
* Anyone is encouraged to review anything that interests them.  However, someone familiar with the changed code should ultimately merge the pull request.
* Some changes can be reviewed by reading the code alone; others require running the code, examples, and tests.
* Most pull requests require additional commits, often minor but sometimes major, before being merged.
* Comments are about code, not the person who wrote the code.  Don't be offended by a reviewer's comments and don't aim to offend when commenting.  We all have the same vision and want the same thing - to be awesome.
* Be concise.  Make every word tell.  Less reading means more coding.
* Provide motivation.  Unless it is obvious, don't just suggest a change.  Suggest _why_ the change should be made.
* See the forest through the trees.  Don't just review code one line at a time.  Consider the big picture and its implications.
* Bring other people into the conversation.  If someone has expertise with a particular language feature or problem domain under review, invite them to help.

A pull request is a sincere request for feedback, and those reviewing the request work with the developer to get the code merged.
