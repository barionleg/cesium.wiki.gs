Implementation ideas for rendering the ocean.

* Fresnel - reflection and refraction depend on the view angle.
* Use specular map so when water is near land,
   * it flows differently
   * it is shallower and therefore animates and renders differently.
* Use dynamic branch to discard fragments based on distance. No need to perform all the wave sampling when the `fadeFactor` is going cancel out the effect.
* Utilize the alpha channel in the `baseWaterColor` and `blendColor` to add additional translucency to the water. May be useful to view terrain, models, etc. under the water.

## Done

* _Done:_ Implement by creating a material with [Fabric](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/wiki/Fabric).
* _Done:_ We have noise functions to animate the water.  Check the reference help for our GLSL built-ins.
* _Done:_ Use a specular map so we know what is water and what is land.  Let's not worry about the resolution for the moment.  Coastlines will look bad.
