*Most Important*

* Sensor improvements
   * Narrow six-arc-second field-of-view.  Display condition to draw a polyline?
   * Narrow sensor like a fan
   * Wide sensor with a cap

*Important*

* Sensor improvements
   * Draw a cone from the Sun to Earth's silhouette.  Compute custom sensor?
* Sun centered views (Should ultimately support any CB as the center)
* Render moon
* Ability jump to a particular stored view that might be defined at the start of a track

*Less Important*

* Sensor improvements
   * Billboard aligned with sensor boresight (use a model?)
* Render other planets
* Draw planes perpendicular to orbits

## Done
* ~~Ability to show Earth-centered view in ICRF instead of Fixed. - [#825](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/825)~~
* ~~Viewing in LLVH - [#531](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/531) [#818](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/818)~~
* ~~Render sun~~.
* ~~More precise sun position.~~ [#391](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/391)
* ~~Inertial frame~~
* ~~Polyline - per-vertex color for passes.  Will [materials] (https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/wiki/Fabric) on polylines work?~~
* ~~Ellipsoid improvements~~
   * ~~Eliminate jitter - [#392](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/392)~~
   * ~~Zoom inside - [#390](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/390)~~
   * ~~Covariance interpolation (in [czml-writer](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/czml-writer))~~
