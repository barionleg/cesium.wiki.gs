*Most Important*

* Sensor improvements.  Test cases:
   * Narrow six-arc-second field-of-view.  Display condition to draw a polyline?
   * Narrow sensor like a fan
   * Wide sensor with a cap
   * Custom sensors with 100s to a 1,000 points
* Fuzzy ellipsoid lines.  [#899](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/899)

*Important*

* Lighting conditions: umbra and penumbra cones
* Sun and moon labels? [#1218](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/1218)
* Mouse wheel is slow for long view distances. [#1011](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/1011)
* CZML support for stored views
* Draw two vectors with an arc for the angle and an annotation

*Less Important*

* Textured plane aligned with sensor boresight (use a model?)
* Draw individual stars from a database.

## Done
* ~~Ability to show Earth-centered view in ICRF instead of Fixed. - [#825](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/825)~~
* ~~Viewing in LLVH - [#531](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/531) [#818](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/818)~~
* ~~Render sun~~.
* ~~More precise sun position.~~ [#391](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/391)
* ~~Inertial frame~~
* ~~Polyline - per-vertex color for passes.  Will [materials] (https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/wiki/Fabric) on polylines work?~~
* ~~Ellipsoid improvements~~
   * ~~Eliminate jitter - [#392](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/392)~~
   * ~~Zoom inside - [#390](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/390)~~
   * ~~Covariance interpolation (in [czml-writer](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/czml-writer))~~
* ~~Sun size. [#769](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/769)~~
* ~~Render moon with right size and lighting.  We already have the moon position, [#677](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/pull/677)~~
* ~~Night time.~~ [#1251](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/pull/1251)
