[Cesium](http://cesiumjs.org/) is an open-source JavaScript library for creating 3D globes and 2D maps in a web browser without a plugin. It uses HTML5 and [WebGL](http://www.khronos.org/webgl) for hardware-accelerated graphics.  Our code has shipped to [10's of millions of people in the same day](http://cesiumjs.org/demos/noradtrackssanta.html) and is used all around the world in fields as diverse as GIS, aerospace, real estate, sports, and entertainment.

We have a culture of writing clean, peer-reviewed, tested code.  Our developers are experts in their fields; they write books, create open standards, and present at international conferences.  We look forward to helping you grow your skills and ship beautiful code that has wide impact.

## Advice for Student Applications

When we look at student applications, we look for students who love to dive deep into a problem, research it carefully, experiment with potential solutions, and then code, test, and document the best implementation.  We like to see passionate, craftsmanship, and conscientiousness.

To get your GSoC application noticed, take an afternoon or a weekend and write a small demo using Cesium, post it to GitHub, and then include a link in your application.  Get up to speed by reading the Cesium [tutorials](http://cesiumjs.org/tutorials.html), then get inspired by the [code examples](http://cesiumjs.org/Cesium/Apps/Sandcastle/) and [demos](http://cesiumjs.org/demos.html).

If instead of writing a demo, you would rather make a contribution to Cesium itself to help your GSoC application stand out, see the [Cesium Contributor's Guide](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/wiki/Contributor%27s-Guide) and [list of beginner issues](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abeginner).  Pick something that interests you then send us a pull request when it is ready.  Note that we can't merge a pull request until you submit a signed [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you need help, post a question to the [Google Summer of Code 2015 thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cesium-dev/QnOxsA0iwa0) on the Cesium forum.  The core developers are active on the forum and will be happy to respond.

**Technologies and Tools We Use**

JavaScript, HTML, CSS, WebGL, GitHub, Eclipse, Chrome, Firefox, Android, iOS

(We don't expect you to know all of them).

## Suggest your own idea

We're excited to hear your ideas for projects that would benefit the Cesium community.  Perhaps your interested in WebGL and JavaScript optimization, and want to improve the core engine?  Perhaps you are passionate about geospatial data formats and want to write new loaders for Cesium?  Or perhaps you are excited about [WebVR](http://mozvr.com/posts/webvr-lands-in-nightly/) and want to create the ultimate virtual reality app with Cesium?

Whatever it is, we want to hear about it!  Pitch your idea and find a mentor by posting a short description to the [Google Summer of Code 2015 thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cesium-dev/QnOxsA0iwa0) on the Cesium forum.

_Tip_: the best way to get a potential mentors attention is to code a quick prototype ([start here](http://cesiumjs.org/2013/04/12/Cesium-up-and-running/)) and post it on GitHub.
