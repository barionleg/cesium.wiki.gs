[Cesium](http://cesiumjs.org/) is an open-source JavaScript library for creating 3D globes and 2D maps in a web browser without a plugin. It uses HTML5 and [WebGL](http://www.khronos.org/webgl) for hardware-accelerated graphics.  Our code has shipped to [10's of millions of people in the same day](http://cesiumjs.org/demos/noradtrackssanta.html) and is used all around the world in fields as diverse as GIS, aerospace, real estate, sports, and entertainment.

We have a culture of writing clean, peer-reviewed, tested code.  Our developers are experts in their fields; they write books, create open standards, and present at international conferences.  We look forward to helping you grow your skills and ship beautiful code that has wide impact.

The period for submitting student proposals for 2013 has now closed.  We had a great number of proposals submitted, thanks to everyone who participated!

Congratulations to [our two GSoC students](http://cesiumjs.org/2013/05/28/Welcome-Google-Summer-of-Code-Students/)!

See this year's [GSoC schedule](http://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2013) for a roadmap of GSoC milestones this summer.

## Improve your chances next year

We would have loved to accept everyone who was sending us pull requests, but this is our first year participating in GSoC.  If we are invited back next year, you can start improving your chances now, just by getting involved and learning our codebase.  Clone it from GitHub, and try making some simple modifications to it.  See the list of issues and our [roadmap](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/wiki/Roadmap) for ideas.

Take a look at the [list of issues for beginners](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues?labels=beginner&state=open), or the [complete list of Cesium issues](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues?labels=&page=1&state=open), and see what needs more work.

All of Cesium's code is covered by a Contributor's License Agreement (CLA), which basically authorizes Cesium developers and users to use the code you're contributing to us.  You'll need to read the instructions for [contributing to Cesium](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and email us a signed CLA before we can accept any code changes.

If you need help, just ask on our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cesium-dev).

# Suggest your own idea

We're excited to hear your ideas for projects that would benefit the Cesium community.  Perhaps your interested in WebGL and JavaScript optimization, and want to improve the core engine?  Perhaps you are passionate about geospatial data formats and want to write new loaders for Cesium?  Or perhaps you are excited about [WebVR](http://mozvr.com/posts/webvr-lands-in-nightly/) and want to create the ultimate virtual reality app with Cesium?

Whatever it is, we want to hear about it!  Pitch your idea and find a mentor by posting a short description to the [Google Summer of Code 2015 thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cesium-dev/QnOxsA0iwa0) on the Cesium forum.

_Tip_: the best way to get a potential mentors attention is to code a quick prototype ([start here](http://cesiumjs.org/2013/04/12/Cesium-up-and-running/)) and post it on GitHub.
