Fabric is a JSON schema for describing materials in Cesium.  Materials represent the appearance of an object such as polygons and sensors.

Materials can be as simple as draping an image over an object, or applying a pattern such as stripes or a checkerboard.  Materials can be more complex such as procedural wood or view-dependent reflection and refraction.
